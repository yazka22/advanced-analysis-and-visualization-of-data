 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced data analysis and visualization of U.S. sales data.  
The goal is to extract meaningful business insights, identify trends, and build predictive models to support decision-making.  
The analysis combines descriptive statistics, interactive dashboards, and time series forecasting.

 📂 Dataset
- File: `Sales.xls`

- Source:Provided dataset (for educational purposes).

🔍 Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
   - Imported data from Excel using `pandas`.
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Summary statistics, distributions, and outlier detection.
   - Correlation analysis with heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
3. Business Questions Answered
